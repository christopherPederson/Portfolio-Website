            "description": "During my second co-op, I embarked on an in-depth exploration of RTL (Resistor-Transistor Logic) and its integration within contemporary architectural frameworks. Motivated by this research, I undertook the ambitious task of fabricating custom logic circuits. Commencing with the development of a specialized board optimized for the characterization of individual transistors, I meticulously captured their behaviors via exhaustive data acquisition and meticulous graphing. This foundational endeavor facilitated a nuanced comprehension of the intricate relationship between base current and emitter current, crucial for grasping transistor gain dynamics. With this foundational knowledge in hand, I transitioned to the construction of essential logic gates, commencing with the pivotal NOT gateâ€”a cornerstone for subsequent circuitry. Progressing to more sophisticated constructs, I engineered a NAND gate, delving into the complex interplay of transistors to realize intricate logical operations. Subsequently, I ventured into the realm of sequential logic, where I meticulously designed RS and D-type flip-flops. These achievements marked a significant leap into the domain of memory elements and state retention, necessitating meticulous consideration of timing constraints and signal propagation dynamics. Through these endeavors, I not only solidified my proficiency in RTL circuit design but also deepened my understanding of fundamental computer architecture principles.",
