This research led me to design custom logic circuits, starting with a specialized board for transistor characterization. I captured and graphed their behaviors to understand the relationship between base and emitter currents, crucial for analyzing transistor gain dynamics. Using this knowledge, I built essential logic gates, including the NOT and NAND gates, and advanced to designing RS and D-type flip-flops. These projects enhanced my skills in RTL design and broadened my grasp of computer architecture fundamentals.",
